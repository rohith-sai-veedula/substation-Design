## Substation Design using AutoCAD Single Line Diagram
This project involved creating a detailed single line diagram using AutoCAD for a 33kV/11kV substation. Components such as lightning arrestors, current transformers, potential transformers, vacuum circuit breakers, and isolators were carefully integrated into the diagram.
Through research and analysis, I applied electrical engineering principles to accurately represent the system. Using AutoCAD's tools, I precisely positioned each component to reflect real-world connections and configurations.
This project enhanced my understanding of substation design and improved my proficiency in AutoCAD. By following industry standards and best practices, the goal was to create a reliable and efficient electrical system layout.
Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome to ensure the accuracy and usability of the single line diagram.
